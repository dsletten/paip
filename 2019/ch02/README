Norvig's game plan for ch. 2:
- Basic function-based grammar grammar-simple.lisp
- Extended function-based grammar shows complication of approach grammar2.lisp

- Basic rule-based grammar grammar-rules.lisp
- Extended rule-based grammar does not require change to code (GENERATE function). [See grammar-rules.lisp]
- Extend program (parse tree) with same set of rules. [See grammar-rules.lisp]

(grammar.lisp is old equivalent to grammar2.lisp with more extensive vocabulary (more terminals))
